<h2>Javascript</h2>
<p>
    JavaScript is an object-based script programming language. The language is mainly used within web browsers and has the ability to access embedded objects in other applications.
    It is also used for server programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications Corporation under the name Mocha and later LiveScript, which eventually became JavaScript.
    JavaScript has similar syntax to Sun Microsystems' Java, but in fact, both languages are based on the basic syntax of the C language, and Java and JavaScript have a weak direct connection with JavaScript is weak.
    Other than name and syntax, there are more similarities to self or scheme than Java.
    JavaScript is recognized as the best implementation of the standard specification of ECMAScript, and up to ECMAScript 5 (ES5) was natively supported by most browsers, but since ECMAScript 6, it is compiled into Transfiler for browser compatibility.
