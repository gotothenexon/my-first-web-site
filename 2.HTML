    Cascading Style Sheet (also known as Cascading Style Sheet) is a style language that describes how a markup language is actually displayed (Style sheet language[*]), which is mainly used in HTML and XHTML, and can also be used in XML. It is the standard of W3C and has a high degree of freedom in defining layout and style. The default filename [2] is style.css.
    If the markup language (ex: HTML) is responsible for the body of a website, the CSS is responsible for decorating like clothes and accessories. In other words, if you leave the HTML structure intact and change the CSS file, you can decorate it like a completely different website.
    For CSS3 currently under development, features that can replace images produced by graphic editing programs such as shadow effects, gradations, and variations have been added. In addition, various animation features have been added to replace Adobe Flash to some extent.
